            <h2>Dangers of "busting"</h2>
            <p>If the total of the cards in your hand or the dealer’s hand adds up to more than 21, that is referred to as a bust.</p>
            <p>If the dealer busts by exceeding 21 after taking a hit, all remaining hands that are at 21 or lower win their bet. The dealer then pays out all winning hands accordingly.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately, if both the player and the dealer exceed 21 and busts, the player would still lose their hand and bet based on the fact that they busted first.</p>
            <p>In the event of a tie (or push, as it is also called) in Blackjack, where neither the player nor the dealer wins, the player’s original bet is returned. No winnings are awarded, but no losses are incurred either. The round is considered a draw, and the player can choose to place another bet for the next hand.</p>
